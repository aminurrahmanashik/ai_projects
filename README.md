# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter texts

Sentiment analysis means the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral. On social media everyday lots of people share their opinion. Some opinions are positive and some are negative. Using sentiment analysis, we will be able to know the mode of the user. 
It is a group project with a cooperation of 4 members. Here,
we tried to classify sentments of twitter texts given by any user. If anyone  We developed an UI interface where 

# Outcomes
    1. Classification of any real world twitter text as positive or negative
    2. Percentize a real world twitter dataset(collected from different social medias) and show that in pie chart
